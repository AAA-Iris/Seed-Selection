# Seed Selection for Testing Deep Neural Networks

# Files
- models - models used on different datasets, the suffix '_1' represents the model uses the same architecture but with different parameters.
- selected_seeds - the selected seeds under different configurations, the name of file 'strategy_number' represents the seed selection strategy and the number of selected seeds.

coverage-guided-optimization.py is to select seeds using coverage. 

uncertainty-guided-optimization.py is to select seeds using uncertainty metric.

retrain.py is to select test cases for model retraining. 

# Coming soon
More details would be included soon.
